    "\n",
    "- **`pip`**: Stands for \"Pip Installs Packages.\" It is the default package manager for Python, used to install and manage software packages written in Python. With `pip`, you can download and install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pip3`**: It is the version of `pip` specifically for **Python 3**. When Python 2 and Python 3 coexist on the same machine, you might need `pip3` to manage Python 3 packages. This helps to avoid conflicts, as Python 2 uses `pip`, and Python 3 uses `pip3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who Uses What?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pip`**: Typically used for **Python 2.x** environments. If you're working on a system where Python 2 is the default interpreter, `pip` will install packages for Python 2.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`pip3`**: This is used for **Python 3.x** environments. If you're working with Python 3, it's safer to use `pip3` to install packages, ensuring that they are installed in the Python 3 environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Mac users**: By default, macOS has Python 2 pre-installed, and when using Python 3, you should use **`pip3`** to install Python 3 packages. This ensures that the packages are installed for the correct version of Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Verify Selenium Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure Selenium was installed correctly, open a Python shell or a script and run:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import selenium\n",
    "print(selenium.__version__)\n",

    "- **For Chrome (ChromeDriver)**:\n",
    "  - Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver for your system from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).\n",
    "  - Unzip the file and move it to a directory in your system's PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin` (for macOS and Linux) or set its path explicitly in your script.\n",

    "  Example for using ChromeDriver:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Provide the path to chromedriver\n",
    "  driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')\n",
    "  driver.get('https://www.google.com')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Firefox (GeckoDriver)**:\n",
    "  - Download GeckoDriver from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).\n",
    "  - Unzip and move it to a directory in your system's PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example for using GeckoDriver:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Provide the path to geckodriver\n",
    "  driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='/path/to/geckodriver')\n",
    "  driver.get('https://www.google.com')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Running a Basic Selenium Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a basic example of using Selenium with Python to automate a web browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')  # Use Firefox with GeckoDriver if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a webpage\n",
    "driver.get('https://www.google.com')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interact with the page (e.g., search for something)\n",
    "search_box = driver.find_element_by_name('q')\n",
    "search_box.send_keys('Selenium Python')\n",
    "search_box.submit()\n",

    "# Close the browser after the test\n",
    "driver.quit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "- Always keep both **Selenium** and the **web driver** up to date to avoid compatibility issues.\n",
    "- Store the web driver path in environment variables to avoid hard-coding paths in your scripts.\n",

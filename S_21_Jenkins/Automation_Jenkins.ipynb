    "## **How to Integrate Selenium Python framework into Jenkins CI tool?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate a **Selenium Python testing framework** into **Jenkins CI** tool, follow the step-by-step guide below. Jenkins can automate running your Selenium tests in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, providing reports and scheduling test runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jenkins installed and running on your local machine or server.\n",
    "- A working Selenium Python test framework (using tools like `pytest`, `unittest`, or others).\n",
    "- Python and `pip` installed on the machine running Jenkins.\n",
    "- A Jenkins job ready to be configured.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Steps to Integrate Selenium Python Tests in Jenkins\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Install Required Jenkins Plugins\n",
    "- **Login to Jenkins** at `http://localhost:8080` or your server URL.\n",
    "- Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.\n",
    "- In the **Available** tab, search for the following plugins and install them:\n",
    "  - **ShiningPanda** (provides Python support).\n",
    "  - **HTML Publisher** (for publishing test reports if your framework generates HTML reports).\n",
    "  \n",
    "Restart Jenkins after installing the plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create a Python Virtual Environment\n",
    "It’s a good practice to run your tests in an isolated environment. You can create a virtual environment inside your Selenium project folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your project directory, run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the environment:\n",
    "- **macOS/Linux**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Windows**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the necessary dependencies like Selenium, PyTest, etc.:\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "   - Select **Provide Python environment**. This option comes from the **ShiningPanda Plugin**.\n",
    "   - Specify your Python installation. You can choose:\n",
    "     - **System-CPython**: If Python is installed on your system.\n",
    "     - Or you can specify the path to your Python interpreter inside your virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up the Build Step**:\n",
    "   - In the **Build** section, click **Add build step** > **Virtualenv Builder**.\n",
    "   - In the **Command** box, add the command to run your Selenium tests (e.g., if you’re using `pytest`):\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "     pytest --html=report.html\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This command runs your tests and generates an HTML report.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: (Optional) Publish Test Reports\n",
    "If your framework generates reports (e.g., `pytest` generates HTML reports using `pytest-html`), you can publish them in Jenkins.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After configuring the build steps, go to **Post-build Actions**.\n",
    "2. Click **Add post-build action** > **Publish HTML reports**.\n",
    "3. In **HTML directory to archive**, specify the folder where the report is generated (e.g., the directory where `report.html` is stored).\n",
    "4. Provide the **HTML file** (`report.html`) and a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Running Your Jenkins Job\n",
    "- Save the job configuration.\n",
    "- Go back to the Jenkins dashboard and click **Build Now** to run the job manually.\n",
    "- Jenkins will execute your Selenium Python tests. You can view the progress in the **Console Output** of the build.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Step 6: Automate the Process (Optional)\n",
    "You can automate the job to run on a schedule or trigger it after every commit in your version control system (e.g., Git).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the job configuration, under **Build Triggers**, select **Poll SCM** or **Build periodically**.\n",
    "2. Provide a cron schedule, e.g., `H/5 * * * *` to run every 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Jenkins Console Output:\n",
    "In the **Console Output**, you will see logs from the execution of your Selenium Python tests:\n",
    "```\n",
    "============================================ test session starts ============================================\n",
    "platform linux -- Python 3.9.7, pytest-6.2.5, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1\n",

    "============================================= 2 passed in 15.06s ==============================================\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: View the HTML Test Report\n",
    "After the job completes, if you configured the HTML Publisher, you can view the test report:\n",
    "- Go to the job page in Jenkins.\n",
    "- In the left-hand menu, you will see a link for **Test Results** (or whatever name you gave your report in **Post-build Actions**).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Final Notes:\n",
    "- If you're running Selenium tests that require a browser, use **headless mode** (especially for Jenkins running on servers without a GUI).\n",
    "- You can integrate **Slack** or **Email notifications** for test results by configuring plugins in Jenkins.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can automate and continuously run your Selenium Python tests through Jenkins.\n",

    "        booleanParam(name: 'RUN_SMOKE_TESTS', defaultValue: false, description: 'Whether to run smoke tests')\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    stages {\n",
    "        stage('Run Tests') {\n",
    "            steps {\n",
    "                script {\n",
    "                    echo \"Running in environment: ${params.ENVIRONMENT}\"\n",
    "                    echo \"Browser selected: ${params.BROWSER}\"\n",
    "                    if (params.RUN_SMOKE_TESTS) {\n",
    "                        echo \"Running smoke tests\"\n",
    "                    } else {\n",

    "Browser selected: Chrome\n",
    "Running smoke tests\n",
    "Finished: SUCCESS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases for Jenkins Parameterized Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment-Specific Builds**: Specify the environment (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) in which to deploy or test.\n",
    "2. **Browser Testing**: Choose different browsers (e.g., `Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Safari`) to run Selenium tests.\n",
    "3. **Feature Toggles**: Use boolean parameters to decide whether to enable or disable features.\n",
    "4. **API Keys or Credentials**: Use password parameters to securely input sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Notes:\n",
    "- **Parameterized jobs** make automation more flexible by allowing dynamic inputs.\n",

    "### Final Notes:\n",
    "- **JUnit** reports are critical in Jenkins for parsing and visualizing test results.\n",
    "- Using the `--junitxml` option in Pytest ensures compatibility with Jenkins test result reporting.\n",
    "- If tests fail, Jenkins will display the failures directly in the UI, along with the detailed error messages and stack traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can easily integrate Pytest with Jenkins and have detailed test results displayed on your CI/CD pipelines.\n",

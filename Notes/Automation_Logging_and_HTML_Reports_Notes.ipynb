    "## **How to generate HTML reports of pytest**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate HTML reports for your Pytest tests using the `pytest-html` plugin. This plugin allows you to create an easy-to-read HTML report after running your tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Generate HTML Reports in Pytest:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Install `pytest-html` Plugin**\n",
    "First, you need to install the `pytest-html` plugin using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install pytest-html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Run Pytest with HTML Report Option**\n",
    "After the plugin is installed, you can generate an HTML report by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --html=report.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will run your tests and generate an HTML report named `report.html` in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Customize the HTML Report**\n",
    "You can add a title and some additional metadata (like environment info) to your HTML report using extra options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html --capture=tee-sys \\\n",
    "    --tb=short --maxfail=5 \\\n",
    "    --metadata=Environment,Staging --metadata=Browser,Chrome\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `--html=report.html`: Specifies the output file for the HTML report.\n",
    "- `--self-contained-html`: Embeds all the assets (CSS, JS) inside the report file.\n",
    "- `--capture=tee-sys`: Ensures output is displayed to both stdout and captured in the report.\n",
    "- `--metadata=Key,Value`: Adds extra metadata (e.g., environment, browser) to the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Viewing the Report**\n",
    "Once the tests are finished, open the `report.html` file in any browser to view the test results, including pass/fail status, stack traces, and logs for failed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --html=results/test_report.html --self-contained-html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will generate a detailed HTML report with all test results, including test execution times, errors, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Features:\n",
    "- **Screenshots**: You can capture and include screenshots in the report if a test fails (useful in UI tests).\n",
    "- **Logs**: You can also capture logs or output to be included in the report.\n",

    "## **Introduction to Logging in Python Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is an essential part of developing and debugging software, and this holds true for testing as well. Logging in Python provides a way to track events that happen during the execution of a program. When writing tests, logging can be used to capture relevant information about test execution, helping you debug issues and get insights into test behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Logging in Tests?\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Logs provide detailed insights into the flow of execution and the state of variables.\n",
    "- **Error Tracking**: It becomes easier to track down the root cause of errors when failures happen.\n",
    "- **Test Reports**: Logs are often included in test reports, providing context for test failures and helping developers understand what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python's `logging` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `logging` module allows you to track events in your application, both during development and testing. Unlike print statements, logging can capture different levels of events (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`), which can be configured to show or hide certain information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Usage of `logging`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can set up basic logging in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure basic logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n",
    "logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n",
    "logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n",
    "logging.error(\"This is an error message\")\n",
    "logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Logging in Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing tests, logging can provide real-time feedback about the flow and state of your tests. You can add logging to your test cases to capture detailed information about test execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Logging in Unit Tests with `unittest`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging for the test module\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "class TestLoggingExample(unittest.TestCase):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def test_addition(self):\n",
    "        logging.info(\"Starting test_addition\")\n",
    "        result = 1 + 1\n",
    "        logging.debug(f\"Result of addition: {result}\")\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(result, 2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def test_division(self):\n",
    "        logging.info(\"Starting test_division\")\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            result = 10 / 0\n",
    "        except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "            logging.error(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "            self.fail(\"Division by zero occurred\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    unittest.main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging Levels\n",
    "- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
    "- **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "- **WARNING**: Indication of something unexpected or potential issues.\n",
    "- **ERROR**: A more serious issue preventing a function from working.\n",
    "- **CRITICAL**: A severe error that likely leads to program termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging in Pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Pytest, you can integrate logging into your tests as well. Pytest provides built-in support for logging and can capture logs during test execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Logging in Pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_logging_in_pytest():\n",
    "    logging.info(\"Starting the test in pytest\")\n",
    "    result = 5 + 3\n",
    "    logging.debug(f\"Result is {result}\")\n",
    "    assert result == 8\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_logging_failure():\n",
    "    logging.info(\"Starting the failing test\")\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pytest Log Capture\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytest automatically captures logs and displays them in case of test failures. To display logs even for passing tests, you can use the `--log-cli-level` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --log-cli-level=INFO\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring Logging in `pytest.ini`\n",
    "You can configure logging globally for your Pytest test suite by modifying the `pytest.ini` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "# pytest.ini\n",
    "[pytest]\n",
    "log_cli = true\n",
    "log_level = INFO\n",
    "log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s\n",
    "log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that logging is enabled and configured for all your tests without needing to modify individual test files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Logging in Tests\n",
    "- **Use appropriate logging levels**: Use `DEBUG` for development, and `INFO` or `ERROR` for reporting significant events or errors.\n",
    "- **Capture important test steps**: Log key steps in your tests, like setup, execution, and teardown, to track the flow of the test.\n",
    "- **Avoid excessive logging**: Be cautious with excessive logging, as it can clutter test output and make it difficult to focus on important information.\n",
    "- **Include logs in reports**: If you're generating HTML or other forms of test reports, ensure the logs are included to help analyze test failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is a powerful tool in Python tests that can help you monitor, debug, and understand test execution. By using Python’s built-in `logging` module, you can track key events, capture error messages, and make your test suite more informative. Whether you're using `unittest`, `pytest`, or another test framework, integrating logging will greatly improve your ability to troubleshoot and maintain test code.\n",

    "## **How to integrate pytest logs into html reporting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating Pytest logs into HTML reports is a useful way to provide detailed test execution information, especially when you are generating reports for sharing with stakeholders or team members. You can achieve this by using the `pytest-html` plugin along with Pytest's built-in logging support. Here's how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Integrate Pytest Logs into HTML Reporting:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Install Required Plugins**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need both the `pytest-html` and `pytest-logging` (or simply use the built-in logging configuration) plugins to generate the HTML report and capture logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the necessary dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytest-html pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Set Up Logging Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure logging in your tests so that the logs are captured and displayed in the HTML report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example setup for basic logging configuration in your `pytest.ini`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ini\n",
    "# pytest.ini\n",
    "[pytest]\n",
    "log_cli = true\n",
    "log_cli_level = INFO\n",
    "log_cli_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s\n",
    "log_cli_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\n",
    "log_file = pytest_log.log\n",
    "log_file_level = DEBUG\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure that logging happens for all tests at the specified logging level, and it will capture both `INFO` and `DEBUG` level messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Configure the HTML Report**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate the HTML report using the `pytest-html` plugin. Use the `--html` option when running tests to specify the location of the generated report.\n",
    "\n",
    "To include logs in the HTML report, you also need to enable the `--self-contained-html` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html --log-cli-level=INFO\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will:\n",
    "- Generate an HTML report at `report.html`.\n",
    "- Include logs in the report.\n",
    "- Ensure that all assets (CSS, JS) are embedded in the HTML report, so it is self-contained and easy to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Add Logs to Your Test Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add logging statements to your test cases so that the relevant logs are captured during test execution and included in the HTML report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_example_pass():\n",
    "    logging.info(\"This is a passing test\")\n",
    "    assert 1 == 1\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_example_fail():\n",
    "    logging.info(\"This is a failing test\")\n",
    "    assert 1 == 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this using the previous command (`pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html --log-cli-level=INFO`), both passing and failing tests will include the logs in the HTML report.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Customize Report Title and Other Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also customize the report's title and additional metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html --log-cli-level=INFO \\\n",
    "       --metadata=Environment,Staging --metadata=Browser,Chrome\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will add the metadata to the report for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **View Logs in the HTML Report**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the tests are executed, the `report.html` file will be created in the specified location. Open this file in a web browser to view the following:\n",
    "- **Test results**: Shows which tests passed or failed.\n",
    "- **Logs**: Detailed logs for each test, available as a collapsible section next to each test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Pytest Command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html --log-cli-level=INFO\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Log Output in HTML Report:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the HTML report, under each test case, you will see logs like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2024-09-24 12:30:01 - INFO - This is a passing test\n",
    "2024-09-24 12:30:02 - INFO - This is a failing test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can easily integrate Pytest logs into the generated HTML reports. The `pytest-html` plugin allows you to include the logs in a well-structured, easy-to-read format, making it simple to share detailed test execution information.\n",

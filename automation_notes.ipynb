    "- Version Check:\n",
    "    - When your Selenium script starts, it checks the version of the installed Chrome browser.\n",
    "- Download Matching ChromeDriver:\n",
    "    - If the correct version of ChromeDriver isn't installed, Selenium can download the appropriate version from the official ChromeDriver site.\n",
    "- Installation:\n",
    "    - The downloaded ChromeDriver is then installed locally and used for the Selenium session.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1. **Update the Value Using JavaScript**\n",
    "   You can use JavaScript to update a web element's value (e.g., for an input field) and then retrieve the updated value using the appropriate Selenium method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Retrieve the Updated Value**\n",
    "   After updating the value through the script, you can use `get_attribute(\"value\")` for input fields or `text` for other elements like `div`, `span`, etc.\n",

    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n",
    "driver.get(\"https://example.com\")\n",

    "updated_text = element.text\n",
    "print(\"Updated Text:\", updated_text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`execute_script`**: This is used to run JavaScript code within the browser context. You can update the DOM directly with this.\n",
    "2. **`get_attribute(\"value\")`**: For input fields, this retrieves the current value after the change.\n",

    "## Implicit Wait vs. Explicit Wait in Selenium (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Selenium, **waiting** is crucial because it allows the script to pause for a certain period to ensure that web elements are fully loaded before performing any actions on them. There are two types of waits in Selenium: **Implicit Wait** and **Explicit Wait**. Both are used to handle scenarios where web elements take time to appear or become interactable, but they work differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Implicit Wait**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Implicit wait tells the WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find any element(s). Once you set the implicit wait, it applies globally to all elements in the script.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: If the element is not immediately available, the WebDriver will wait for a specified duration before throwing a `NoSuchElementException`. If the element is found within the wait time, the script continues executing without waiting for the entire duration.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Code Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n",
    "driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # Wait for a maximum of 10 seconds for elements to appear\n",
    "\n",
    "driver.get(\"https://example.com\")\n",
    "element = driver.find_element_by_id(\"someElementId\")  # Will wait up to 10 seconds for the element to appear\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Use**: Implicit wait is useful for most scenarios where you need to wait for elements across the whole script. However, it doesn't provide flexibility for different waits on specific elements or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Explicit Wait**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Explicit wait is used to wait for a **specific condition** to occur before proceeding with the execution. Unlike implicit wait, explicit wait is applied to individual elements and conditions.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: With explicit wait, you define a wait condition (e.g., element to be visible, clickable, presence in the DOM, etc.). The WebDriver will wait for that specific condition to be true within a maximum time frame. If the condition is not met within the time limit, a `TimeoutException` is thrown.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Code Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n",
    "from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n",
    "from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n",
    "\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n",
    "driver.get(\"https://example.com\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait until the element with the specific ID is visible, with a maximum wait time of 10 seconds\n",
    "element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(\n",
    "    EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, \"someElementId\"))\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Use**: Explicit waits are useful when specific elements require different waiting times or conditions. For instance, when waiting for a button to become clickable or waiting for a specific element to load after an AJAX call.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between Implicit and Explicit Waits\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Implicit Wait**                               | **Explicit Wait**                                 |\n",
    "|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",

    "| No control over different conditions            | Control over various conditions (e.g., clickable, visible) |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `driver.find_elements` is an Exception\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of the `find_elements` method differs from `find_element`, which explains why it behaves differently in terms of throwing exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`driver.find_element`**: This method **returns a single web element** and throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the element is not found within the wait time (either implicit or explicit).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`driver.find_elements`**: This method **returns a list of web elements**. If no elements are found, it **returns an empty list** rather than throwing an exception. Therefore, you won't see an exception like `NoSuchElementException` even if the elements are not present on the page. This makes `find_elements` useful when you expect multiple elements and want to handle scenarios where none of them are present without raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of `find_elements`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elements = driver.find_elements(By.ID, \"someElementId\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if not elements:\n",
    "    print(\"No elements found!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    for element in elements:\n",
    "        print(element.text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `find_elements` will return an empty list if no elements are found, which is an expected behavior and doesn't cause an exception, allowing you to handle the absence of elements smoothly in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implicit Wait**: Waits globally for a specified amount of time for elements to appear in the DOM before throwing an exception.\n",
    "- **Explicit Wait**: Waits for specific conditions on certain elements, offering more control and flexibility.\n",
    "- **`find_elements` Exception**: `find_elements` returns an empty list when no elements are found instead of raising an exception, which is why it behaves differently from `find_element`."

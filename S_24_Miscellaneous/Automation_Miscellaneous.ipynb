    "## **Configure your WebDriver to download files to a specific location in project folder**\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure your **Selenium WebDriver** to download files to a specific folder within your project directory, you can use **ChromeOptions** (or **FirefoxOptions** for Firefox) to set the desired download directory. Below is the Python code that demonstrates how to configure the WebDriver to download files to a specific folder within your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Set the default download directory to a folder inside your project directory.\n",
    "2. Use Selenium’s WebDriver to download files automatically without the download prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the current working directory (your project folder)\n",
    "project_dir = os.getcwd()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the desired download folder within the project directory\n",
    "download_dir = os.path.join(project_dir, \"downloads\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the 'downloads' directory if it doesn't exist\n",
    "if not os.path.exists(download_dir):\n",
    "    os.makedirs(download_dir)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure Chrome options to set the download directory\n",
    "chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set Chrome preferences for file download behavior\n",
    "prefs = {\n",
    "    \"download.default_directory\": download_dir,  # Set the download directory\n",
    "    \"download.prompt_for_download\": False,       # Disable download prompts\n",
    "    \"directory_upgrade\": True,                   # Auto-upgrade the download directory\n",
    "    \"safebrowsing.enabled\": True                 # Enable safe browsing\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"prefs\", prefs)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the WebDriver with Chrome options\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Navigate to the page with the downloadable file\n",
    "driver.get(\"https://example.com/path/to/downloadable/file\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Click to trigger file download\n",
    "download_link = driver.find_element_by_link_text(\"Download\")\n",
    "download_link.click()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a sleep or wait mechanism to ensure the download completes\n",
    "# time.sleep(5) or WebDriverWait can be used as required\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the WebDriver\n",
    "driver.quit()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Files will be downloaded to: {download_dir}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`os.getcwd()`**: Retrieves the current working directory of your Python project.\n",
    "2. **`os.path.join()`**: Joins the project directory with the \"downloads\" folder.\n",
    "3. **Creating the folder**: If the folder doesn't exist, it creates one using `os.makedirs()`.\n",
    "4. **ChromeOptions and Preferences**:\n",
    "   - **`download.default_directory`**: Sets the folder where files will be downloaded automatically.\n",
    "   - **`download.prompt_for_download`**: Disables the download confirmation dialog box.\n",
    "   - **`directory_upgrade`**: Automatically updates the download directory if it changes.\n",
    "   - **`safebrowsing.enabled`**: Enables safe browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- **Firefox WebDriver**: You can do similar configuration with **`FirefoxOptions`** using the `\"browser.download.dir\"` preference.\n",
    "- **WebDriver for Different Browsers**: This example is for Chrome. For Firefox, you'll need to configure the `firefox_profile` with appropriate settings for downloads.\n",

    "## **Get the folder name of the file through which the current code**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the folder name of the file through which the current code is being executed in Python Selenium, you can use the `os` module. Here's the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",

    "\n",
    "print(folder_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will output the full path of the directory containing the current script. You can then use string manipulation techniques to extract the folder name if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the script is located in the `scripts` folder within your project directory, the output would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/path/to/your/project/scripts\n",
    "```\n",

    "## **Delete a downloaded file**\n",
    "\n",
    "One can delete a downloaded file using **Selenium** in Python, but it requires the use of the **`os`** module or **`pathlib`** to handle file operations, since Selenium itself doesn't have built-in capabilities to delete files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a general approach you can take to delete a downloaded file after the download completes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Use Selenium to automate the download.\n",
    "2. Use Python’s `os` or `pathlib` to locate the file in the download directory.\n",
    "3. Delete the file programmatically after confirming that it has been downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import time\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure your WebDriver (e.g., Chrome) to download files to a specific location\n",
    "download_dir = \"/path/to/download/directory\"  # Change this to your actual download folder\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chrome options for downloading files without dialog\n",
    "chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n",
    "prefs = {\"download.default_directory\": download_dir}\n",
    "chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"prefs\", prefs)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the WebDriver\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Navigate to a page and trigger a file download\n",
    "driver.get(\"https://example.com/download/file.zip\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for the file to download completely (you might need to adjust this)\n",
    "time.sleep(5)  # or use WebDriverWait with a more reliable condition\n",
    "\n",
    "# File to be deleted\n",
    "file_name = \"file.zip\"\n",
    "file_path = os.path.join(download_dir, file_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if file exists, then delete\n",
    "if os.path.exists(file_path):\n",
    "    os.remove(file_path)\n",
    "    print(f\"File '{file_name}' deleted successfully.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"File '{file_name}' not found.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the WebDriver session\n",
    "driver.quit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Set Download Directory:** Selenium uses browser-specific options to set the default download location. In this case, we're using Chrome’s `download.default_directory` preference.\n",
    "2. **Wait for Download:** A sleep function or more reliable `WebDriverWait` could be used to ensure the file is fully downloaded.\n",
    "3. **Delete the File:** Once the file is downloaded, Python’s `os.remove()` or `pathlib.Path.unlink()` is used to delete the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- **File existence check:** Always ensure the file exists using `os.path.exists()` before trying to delete it.\n",
    "- **WebDriverWait:** Instead of using `time.sleep()`, it’s better to use a more reliable way to check if the download is complete. Selenium doesn't have native download progress checking, but you could periodically check the download directory for the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of `WebDriverWait` approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n",
    "from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the file has been downloaded\n",
    "def wait_for_download(file_path, timeout=30):\n",
    "    start_time = time.time()\n",
    "    while not os.path.exists(file_path):\n",
    "        if time.time() - start_time > timeout:\n",
    "            raise Exception(f\"Timeout waiting for download: {file_path}\")\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trigger the download with Selenium\n",
    "driver.get(\"https://example.com/download/file.zip\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for the download to complete\n",
    "wait_for_download(file_path)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete the downloaded file\n",
    "os.remove(file_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to safely trigger a file download and delete it when done using Selenium.\n",

    "## **Configure your WebDriver to download files to a specific location in project folder**\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure your **Selenium WebDriver** to download files to a specific folder within your project directory, you can use **ChromeOptions** (or **FirefoxOptions** for Firefox) to set the desired download directory. Below is the Python code that demonstrates how to configure the WebDriver to download files to a specific folder within your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Set the default download directory to a folder inside your project directory.\n",
    "2. Use Seleniumâ€™s WebDriver to download files automatically without the download prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the current working directory (your project folder)\n",
    "project_dir = os.getcwd()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the desired download folder within the project directory\n",
    "download_dir = os.path.join(project_dir, \"downloads\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the 'downloads' directory if it doesn't exist\n",
    "if not os.path.exists(download_dir):\n",
    "    os.makedirs(download_dir)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure Chrome options to set the download directory\n",
    "chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set Chrome preferences for file download behavior\n",
    "prefs = {\n",
    "    \"download.default_directory\": download_dir,  # Set the download directory\n",
    "    \"download.prompt_for_download\": False,       # Disable download prompts\n",
    "    \"directory_upgrade\": True,                   # Auto-upgrade the download directory\n",
    "    \"safebrowsing.enabled\": True                 # Enable safe browsing\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "chrome_options.add_experimental_option(\"prefs\", prefs)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the WebDriver with Chrome options\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Navigate to the page with the downloadable file\n",
    "driver.get(\"https://example.com/path/to/downloadable/file\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Click to trigger file download\n",
    "download_link = driver.find_element_by_link_text(\"Download\")\n",
    "download_link.click()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a sleep or wait mechanism to ensure the download completes\n",
    "# time.sleep(5) or WebDriverWait can be used as required\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the WebDriver\n",
    "driver.quit()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Files will be downloaded to: {download_dir}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`os.getcwd()`**: Retrieves the current working directory of your Python project.\n",
    "2. **`os.path.join()`**: Joins the project directory with the \"downloads\" folder.\n",
    "3. **Creating the folder**: If the folder doesn't exist, it creates one using `os.makedirs()`.\n",
    "4. **ChromeOptions and Preferences**:\n",
    "   - **`download.default_directory`**: Sets the folder where files will be downloaded automatically.\n",
    "   - **`download.prompt_for_download`**: Disables the download confirmation dialog box.\n",
    "   - **`directory_upgrade`**: Automatically updates the download directory if it changes.\n",
    "   - **`safebrowsing.enabled`**: Enables safe browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- **Firefox WebDriver**: You can do similar configuration with **`FirefoxOptions`** using the `\"browser.download.dir\"` preference.\n",
    "- **WebDriver for Different Browsers**: This example is for Chrome. For Firefox, you'll need to configure the `firefox_profile` with appropriate settings for downloads.\n",

    "## **Get the folder name of the file through which the current code**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the folder name of the file through which the current code is being executed in Python Selenium, you can use the `os` module. Here's the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the absolute path of the current script\n",
    "script_path = os.path.abspath(__file__)\n",

    "\n",
    "print(folder_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will output the full path of the directory containing the current script. You can then use string manipulation techniques to extract the folder name if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the script is located in the `scripts` folder within your project directory, the output would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/path/to/your/project/scripts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
